Meross Smart plug problems

The Meross smart plug breaks after a few uses.
The switch on this batch of plugs quickly goes from tactile to broken.
Then when you press harder because nothing is happening you feel something going wrong (detached switch).
Looking inside shows the button itself in a bad shape and in the case below detached becasue I pressed harder when it no longer reacted.
This has happend to two of a batch of three plugs I had.
The third one has also lost its tactile feedback but I've taken it out of service BEFORE it completely broke.
Another batch is fine and is still tactile and gives clicky feedback when pressed.
The reason I even had to use the button is that the same batch of plugs also looses wifi forcing one to either use the button or to reset them.
Resetting also requires the button so once it's done it's done.

I've put one of the plugs under the microscope:

And to add insult to injury while I tested the last of three it broke and will no loner switch.
I've not opened it up but it's clearly broken although I was careful.
Three out of three survived each a max of fifty presses (if at all).
